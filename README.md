<strong>A Fitness App</strong>

<a href="https://fitness-app-2018.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">View Project</a>

I created a fitness app using React, Firebase, and Bootstrap 4 to track my fitness progression. and to understand which 
muscle(s) is being targeted for each exercise routine. The application is incorporated using a firebase API I built to dispatch exercises along with their descriptions allowing me to search the proper techniques used for each activity within the app. 

The API is link to 
an SVG node resembling the human body  which encompasses over 320 children nodes --each representing a particular muscle or muscle group 
that comprises the anatonomical structure. When a user clicks or response to an exercise each muscle mutates its color to highlight which muscles are 
being targeted. The application stores my information in the database and logs the workout. The app, using D3.js, displays an interactive bar chart to 
show the max-weight achieved for each workout.
