    "description" : "The squat is a strength-building lower body exercise. It is executed by placing a weighted barbell across your shoulders, then using your legs to lower and raise your body. The movement resembles the act of repeatedly sitting in and standing from a chair. There are many physiological benefits to performing squats regularly. In fact, many athletes view this movement as the most effective exercise for developing total-body strength.",

The exercise works the pectoralis major as well as supporting chest, arm, and shoulder muscles such as the anterior deltoids, serratus anterior, coracobrachialis, scapulae fixers, trapezii, and the triceps.

Your chest, or pectoral muscles, are responsible for two main actions -- flexion and adduction of your upper arm. When your pecs contract, they bring your arms toward the center of your body, with your elbows facing either out to the side or toward the floor. Your shoulder muscles also aid in flexion and adduction, and they help stabilize your shoulder joint. At the top part of the lift, your triceps -- the muscles on the back of your arms -- work to extend your arms.",

Some leg press machines place your body in a declined position, with your head lower than your lower body. Other leg machines place your body in a horizontal position. Resistance can be in the form of weighted plates that are placed on the machine or a weight stack that uses a pin for resistance selection. While your hips and legs bear most of the resistance, the leg press is a safer alternative to the barbell squat, requiring your whole body to bear the weight.",
